# golden-photo-editor


/!\ IN CONSTRUCTION /!\


## quick presentation :

this project was born from my deep love for warm, nostalgic visuals. i love taking pictures, and never apply filters on it, but I love this warm light / golden hour aspect in a picture,
so i just wanted to make my own non-complicated application to process to that kind of SIMPLE changes, even though I prefer the original takes.
but STILL, it can really add charm to the photo :)
because yes, i wanted a simple tool to apply *golden, sun-drenched, or even (sometimes) subtly gray filters* to my photos, with no fancy AI or premium-needed app (even though free stuff still exists, such as the free version VSCO or Picsart that I use). 

i needed warmth, softness, and vintage aesthetics through yellows, oranges, browns... maybe even dusty black-and-white tones for some night pictures.

this app lets me import any picture from my computer and *bathe it in gold*.  
that’s it. simple. aesthetic. efficient. free. DIY. all in the same place. and just what i needed.


## features :

- apply warm-toned filters (yellows, ambers, burnt oranges, warm browns)
- more than **30 custom filter presets** (from honey-glow to dusty ochre, sunset to sepia) 
- adjustable **filter intensity** (because sometimes you want full fire, sometimes just a glow)  
- **transparency slider** (to blend the filter subtly or boldly) 
- optional **greyscale and desaturated warm filters** (for that retro black & white mood)   
- quick preview before applying  
- save the edited image locally  
- designed to be intuitive and easy-to-use


## technologies used :

- `tkinter` – for the GUI  
- `Pillow (PIL)` – for image processing and filter blending  
- `numpy` – for pixel manipulation (especially if we want custom LUT-style effects)  
- `opencv-python` – (optional) for more advanced filter effects or fast preview  
- `matplotlib` – (optional) if you want histogram previews or color curve adjustments later  
- `customtkinter` – (optional) for a soft modern GUI experience


## inspiration :
- myself hahaha


### of course you are absolutely free to re-use it and re-style it as you need and wish :)


a huge pleasure,
